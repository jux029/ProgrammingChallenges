### Understanding the Objective of the Project

1. **Explore the Relationships Among the Datasets**:
   - The `campaign_id` serves as a key to map related data across tables.
   - The data provides insights into campaign performance metrics, among other details.
2. **Showcase SQL Queries**: 
   - This project aims to demonstrate advanced SQL querying capabilities and data analysis.

### Local MySQL Database vs Cloud Database

Pick Local MySQL Database because:
   - **Simplicity**: Setting up and managing a local MySQL server is straightforward.
   - **Cost**: A local server might be more cost-effective, especially for small-scale projects.
   - **Latency**: There's virtually no latency when accessing a local database, as opposed to potential network delays with cloud databases.
   - **Control & Privacy**: Maintain full control over the infrastructure and ensure data privacy, especially if sensitive data is involved.

While cloud databases offer numerous advantages, such as scalability, built-in backups, and remote accessibility, the requirements and constraints of this project made a local MySQL database a more suitable and pragmatic choice.

### Concerns

1. **Scope of Revenue Data**:
   - The dataset for revenue is somewhat limited and might not paint a complete picture of a campaign's efficiency.
   - Not all daily ad revenues align perfectly with daily ad spend data, leading to potential discrepancies in analysis.
